You probably saw they are installed the first time you launch your game, OK, but what happens to these files when they go wasted ? The answer is very simple: Steam doesn't delete them. An example: install the first complete season of Sam & Max (6 episodes): every episode is about ~300MB. For each of them, you can count 100MB for the DirectX redistributable package. Yes, it is about a third of the game files size, and they are not removed by Steam. For 6 episodes, you could save 600MB. Imagine what you could save for 10 or 20 games.\r\n\r\n### The solution:\r\n\r\nA little tool that is able to list every redistributable package stored on your Steam directories, and allows you to remove them. This is the goal of TikiOne-Steam-Cleaner. This is a very simple program: set the Steam SteamApps folder (this is a sub-folder of the Steam application), click \"Search\", you choose what file or folder you want to remove.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
