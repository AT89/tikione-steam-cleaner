<a id="the-good-old-time" class="anchor" href="#the-good-old-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The good old time:</h3>

<p>When you installed a video game from a CD or a DVD, you installed some redistributable packages too: DirectX, Games For Windows Live Redist, VC Redist, Rapture3D, NVidia PhysX Redist, etc. They were installed from the CD/DVD, and those installers didn't stay on your hard drive.</p>

<h3>
<a id="now-steam-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#now-steam-the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Now, Steam, the problem:</h3>

<p>The Steam application allows you to download games from the Internet and install them, but what about these redistributable packages ? You probably saw they are installed the first time you launch your game, OK, but what happens to these files when they go wasted ? The answer is very simple: Steam doesn't delete them. An example: install the first complete season of Sam &amp; Max (6 episodes): every episode is about ~300MB. For each of them, you can count 100MB for the DirectX redistributable package. Yes, it is about a third of the game files size, and they are not removed by Steam. For 6 episodes, you could save 600MB. Imagine what you could save for 10 or 20 games.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The solution:</h3>

<p>A little tool that is able to list every redistributable package stored on your Steam directories, and allows you to remove them. This is the goal of TikiOne-Steam-Cleaner. This is a very simple program: set the Steam SteamApps folder (this is a sub-folder of the Steam application), click "Search", you choose what file or folder you want to remove.</p>
